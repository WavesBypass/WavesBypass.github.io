# Hi, you are probably wondering what is Waves? or wavesbypass
Waves is a app i made, its like a mini os. my inspo was edex-ui, which is beautiful, and very clean. Waves has a custom browser, fully secure and your privacy is safe, its called potato browser, yes funny isnt it. and its also got file explorer, and most stuff a operating system would have! i spent a long time on this, hope everyone enjoys it, stay tuned for more updates.
